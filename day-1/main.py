Personal Agent Twin - A simple CrewAI example for students
============================================================

This script creates an AI agent that acts as your "digital twin" - 
an agent that knows about you and can answer questions on your behalf.

Students: Edit the BACKSTORY section to create your own personal agent!

# STEP 1: Configure your LLM (Language Model)
# ==============================================================================
# This is the "brain" of your agent. You can use OpenAI or Gemini.
# 
# Option 1: OpenAI (default)
# - Set OPENAI_API_KEY in .env file
# - Get key at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
#
# Option 2: Gemini
# - Set GEMINI_API_KEY in .env file  
# - Get key at: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
# - Available models: gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-1.5-pro, gemini-1.5-flash

    You are the digital twin of a student learning AI and CrewAI.
    
    Here's what you know about me:
    - I'm a student learning about AI agents and automation
    - I'm interested in technology, coding, and building cool projects
    - I love experimenting with new tools like CrewAI
    - My favorite programming language is Python
    - I enjoy problem-solving and creative thinking
    
    When someone asks about me, you provide friendly, accurate information
    based on what I've told you about myself. You're helpful, enthusiastic,
    and represent me well in conversations.

# Tasks tell your agent WHAT to do. This task answers questions about you.
